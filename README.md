# DataTalks Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Personal Learning Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal learning repository for the [DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://datatalks.club/blog/data-engineering-zoomcamp.html)! 

This repository contains my own instructions, scripts, and notes based on the course offered by DataTalks.Club. While the original course content serves as a foundation, I've adapted and expanded upon it to create a more personalized learning experience.

## Repository Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
1. To document my learning journey through the Data Engineering Zoomcamp
2. To provide clear, step-by-step instructions for various data engineering tasks
3. To store and organize scripts and configurations I've created during the course
4. To serve as a reference for future projects and learning

## My Approach

While following the Data Engineering Zoomcamp curriculum, I've taken the liberty to:
- Break down complex topics into smaller, more manageable steps
- Provide more detailed explanations where I found the original content challenging
- Add my own insights and learnings from hands-on experience
- Create scripts to automate processes where possible

## Disclaimer

This repository is my personal interpretation and implementation of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp content. For the official course materials and most up-to-date information, please refer to the original [DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

I'd like to express my gratitude to DataTalks.Club for providing the excellent Data Engineering Zoomcamp course that inspired this personal learning journey.
