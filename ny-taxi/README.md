# NY Taxi Data Engineering Playground

This project explores multiple ways to build a local data engineering environment for ingesting and query NYC Tax data using Docker, PosgreSQL, and Python.

# Implementations

- **ny-taxi-uv/**
A modern setup using `uv`, `pyproject.toml`, and Docker.
Focuses on repoducibility, speed, and best practices.

- **ny-taxi-pip/**
A Simpler alternative using `pip` and `requirements.txt`.
Included to compare tradeoffs and mental models

If you're new to the project, start with **ny-taxi-uv**.
